# proj_Colour_randomiser
A site that randomly generates a colour

## Description
<br>
This project was a tutorial I followed partly (freeCodeCamp - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=28s)
Using my existing JS knowledge and extending it to feed JS outputs back to the site.
Once i picked up what the tutorial was doing, i then created my own implementation of it.
